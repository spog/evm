Evm message life:
-----------------
Created messages are being automatically freed, after the last consumer
handler for this message finished its execution, unless message being
set as persistent (evm_message_persistent_set()).

Evm message access:
-------------------
You do not have exclusive access to message, while in the registered
callback message handler. More consumers may read message values in
parallel if, message passed to many consumers or if posted to a topic.

To gain exclusive access to message content, use "evm_message_(un)lock()"
in message handler callback functions.
