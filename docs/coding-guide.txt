The whole project public API naming uses prefix "evm_".
Internal public API naming uses its implementation module file name prefix (i.e. "timers_" ot "messages_").
Do not use above prefixes for internal per module symbols (static finctions and globals), as they can not be seen directly (by name) from other modules.
Internal modules communication tries to follow hierarchical organisation so that a higher level module includes all used headers (submodules) and each submodule includes that higher level header.
